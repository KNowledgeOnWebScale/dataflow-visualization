## Readme

This directory contains the documentation of [global defaults](docs/globaldefaults-doc.md), [nodes](docs/nodes-doc.md)
and [edges](docs/edges-doc.md). These docs are autogenerated
with the tool [json-schema-md-doc by Brian Wendt](https://brianwendt.github.io/json-schema-md-doc/).
In [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md) is explained how to autogenerate the documentation.

The schemas you find in here are autogenerated. Changing these schemas won't have an effect on the application. These
schemas are only here to autogenerate the documentation. For more information about the automatic generation of the
documentation, please see [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md#how-to-autogenerate-the-documentation).
